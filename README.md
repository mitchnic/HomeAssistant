# Home Assistant Add-ons

Collection of my Home Assistant customizations, cards, and experiments.

## Contents

- `Blood-Sugar-Card` — custom Lovelace card for Nightscout glucose values with trend arrow, dynamic color, minutes since last reading, and sparkline.

## Quick Install (Local)

Each project folder includes its own install instructions. For the Blood Sugar card, copy `blood-sugar-card.js` to your Home Assistant `config/www/` folder and add it as a resource.
